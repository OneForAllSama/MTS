# MTS

Official code repository for the paper "Multimodal Taylor Series Network for Misinformation Detection", was accepted by WWW 2025. The model setup, training, and testing code are all included in the `MTS_ALL_IN_ONE_CODE.ipynb` file. We have also saved our running logs for reference.

This is the code file we used in the Weibo dataset. To run our code on the Pheme and Sarcasm datasets, you only need to modify the paths and the way data is loaded.
