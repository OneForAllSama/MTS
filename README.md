# MTS

Official code repository for the paper "Multimodal Taylor Series Network for Misinformation Detection", was accepted by WWW 2025. The model setup, training, and testing code are all included in the `MTS_ALL_IN_ONE_CODE.ipynb` file. We have also saved our running logs for reference.

This is the code file we used in the Weibo dataset. To run our code on the Pheme and Sarcasm datasets, you only need to modify the paths and the way data is loaded.

# Instruction to run our code:
You only need to modify the dataset paths in the ipynb file to the local paths of the open-source datasets used in the paper, and the local paths for the text encoder and tokenizer, then you can run the code.
